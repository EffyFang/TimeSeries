## Load required libraries

## Read data from the data selected from META data file
```{r}
df = readRDS("~/GitHub/TimeSeries-Project/TSProject/new_train.rds")

df1 = df[,10:12]
append = as.numeric(df1[,1])
kidney = as.numeric(df1[,3])
```
For this data set, the main target is the Kidney Stone Disease and want to see if it is possible to improve prediction by including anther disease which is appendicitis in this case. These two data set have a very similar trend in general from the data selection process. 


## Time Series plot for the Kidney Stone 
```{r}
Acf(kidney)
acf(kidney)
```
From the time series plot, we can see the magnitude of the data is various along with time. Also, the ACF plot shows wave in every 7 spikes. Therefore, I choose the frequency 7 in the following analysis. 



## Split train and test data set
```{r}

## Use the last 19 data points as the test data set

append_weekly = ts(append, frequency = 7)
kidney_weekly = ts(kidney, frequency = 7)


append_train_weekly = window(append_weekly, start = c(1,1), end = c(112,7))
append_test_weekly  = window(append_weekly, start = c(113,1), end = c(115,5))


kidney_train_weekly = window(kidney_weekly, start = c(1,1), end = c(112,7))
kidney_test_weekly  = window(kidney_weekly, start = c(113,1), end = c(115,5))


kidney_diff_train = window(diff(kidney_weekly), start = c(1,2), end = c(112,7))
kidney_diff_test = window(diff(kidney_weekly), start = c(113,1), end = c(115,5))


append_diff_train = window(diff(append_weekly), start = c(1,2), end = c(112,7))
append_diff_test = window(diff(append_weekly), start = c(113,1), end = c(115,5))


```


## BoxCox Transformation
```{r}
## 
append_lambda = BoxCox.lambda(append_train_weekly)
append_transformed_train = BoxCox(append_train_weekly, lambda = append_lambda)
append_transformed_test = BoxCox(append_test_weekly, lambda = append_lambda)

kidney_lambda = BoxCox.lambda(kidney_train_weekly)
kidney_transformed_train = BoxCox(kidney_train_weekly, lambda = kidney_lambda)

autoplot(kidney_train_weekly)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly)

kidney_transformed_test = BoxCox(kidney_test_weekly, lambda = kidney_lambda)

autoplot(kidney_transformed_train)+
  autolayer(kidney_transformed_test)

```


## Stationary Test for Appendicitis
```{r}
adf.test(append_transformed_train) # p-value need to be less than 0.05
kpss.test(append_transformed_train) # p-value need to be greater than 0.05

adf.test(diff(append_transformed_train)) # p-value need to be less than 0.05
kpss.test(diff(append_transformed_train)) # p-value need to be greater than 0.05
plot(diff(append_transformed_train))

adf.test(diff(append_train_weekly)) # p-value need to be less than 0.05
kpss.test(diff(append_train_weekly)) # p-value need to be greater than 0.05

```

## Stationary Test for Kidney Stone
```{r}
adf.test(kidney_transformed_train)  # p-value need to be less than 0.05
kpss.test(kidney_transformed_train) # p-value need to be greater than 0.05y


adf.test(diff(diff(kidney_transformed_train)))   # p-value need to be less than 0.05
kpss.test(diff(diff(kidney_transformed_train)))  # p-value need to be greater than 0.05
plot(diff(kidney_transformed_train))

adf.test(diff(kidney_train_weekly))  # p-value need to be less than 0.05
kpss.test(diff(kidney_train_weekly)) # p-value need to be greater than 0.05


```


## TS plot, ACF plot and pacf plot 
```{r}
ts.plot(diff(kidney_transformed_train))
acf(diff(kidney_transformed_train))
pacf(diff(kidney_transformed_train))
```

## Model Selection 
### Auto Arima model
```{r}
# After 1st differencing, the data set is stationary. Thus, set d = 1, and there is strong seasonality trend observed.

arima_atuo_kidney = auto.arima(kidney_transformed_train, d = 1, seasonal = T)
arima_atuo_kidney


# Ljung-Box test need to be greater than 0.05
checkresiduals(arima_atuo_kidney)

pred = forecast(arima_atuo_kidney, h = 19)
inv_pred = InvBoxCox(pred$mean, lambda = kidney_lambda)
acc_atuo = accuracy(inv_pred, kidney_test_weekly)
acc_atuo
autoplot(inv_pred, include = 100)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "Auto_ARIMA", color = "red")


```


### Try Self-defined SARIMA model
```{r}
eacf(kidney_transformed_train)
```
Try different combinations of AR and MA, also for the seasonal part.

```{r}

arima_kidney = Arima(kidney_transformed_train, order = c(1,1,2), seasonal = c(1, 0, 2))
arima_kidney

arima_kidney$coef

# Ljung-Box test need to be greater than 0.05
checkresiduals(arima_kidney)

pred = forecast(arima_kidney, h = 19)
inv_pred = InvBoxCox(pred$mean, lambda = kidney_lambda)
acc_arima = accuracy(inv_pred, kidney_test_weekly)
acc_arima

autoplot(inv_pred, include = 100)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "SARIMA", color = "red")


```


### TBATS model
```{r}


tbats_kidney = tbats(kidney_train_weekly)
tbats_kidney
checkresiduals(tbats_kidney)


pred = forecast(tbats_kidney, h = 19)

acc_tbats = accuracy(pred, kidney_test_weekly)
acc_tbats

autoplot(pred$mean, include = 100)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "tbats", color = "red")


```


### ARFIMA model
```{r}
model_arfima = arfima(kidney_transformed_train)
summary(model_arfima) 
checkresiduals(model_arfima)

pred = forecast(model_arfima, h = 19)
inv_pred = InvBoxCox(pred$mean, lambda = kidney_lambda)

acc_arfima = accuracy(inv_pred, kidney_test_weekly)
acc_arfima

autoplot(inv_pred, include = 10)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "ARFIMA", color = "red")

```


### Regression model with Time Series Residuals
```{r}

model_xreg = auto.arima(kidney_transformed_train, xreg = append_transformed_train  ,seasonal = TRUE)
model_xreg

checkresiduals(model_xreg)

pred = forecast(model_xreg, xreg = append_transformed_test, h = 19)
inv_pred = InvBoxCox(pred$mean, lambda = kidney_lambda)


acc_xreg = accuracy(inv_pred, kidney_test_weekly)
acc_xreg

autoplot(inv_pred, include = 10)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "XREG", color = "red")


```


## Fourier Transformation for Dynamic Harmonic Regression
```{r}

harmonics = fourier(kidney_transformed_train, K =3)
model_fourier = auto.arima(kidney_transformed_train, xreg = harmonics, seasonal = FALSE)

checkresiduals(model_fourier)
summary(model_fourier)

new_harmonics = fourier(kidney_transformed_train, K =3, h = 19)
pred = forecast(model_fourier, xreg = new_harmonics)

inv_pred = InvBoxCox(pred$mean, lambda = kidney_lambda)
acc_fourier = accuracy(inv_pred, kidney_test_weekly)
acc_fourier


autoplot(inv_pred, include = 10)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "SARIMA", color = "red")
```


### VAR model
```{r}
var_data = window(ts.union(diff(kidney_transformed_train), diff(append_transformed_train)))

model_var = VAR(y = var_data, p = 2)
model_var

pred = forecast(model_var, h = 19)
pred_kidney = pred$forecast$diff.kidney_transformed_train.$mean
pred_kidney = ts(pred_kidney, start = c(113,1), end = c(115,5), frequency = 7)

act_pred = append(kidney_transformed_train[784],pred_kidney)
act_pred = cumsum(act_pred)
act_pred = act_pred[2:20]
inv_pred = InvBoxCox(act_pred, lambda = kidney_lambda)
inv_pred = ts(inv_pred, start = c(113,1), end = c(115,5), frequency = 7)
accuracy(inv_pred, kidney_test_weekly)


autoplot(inv_pred, include = 100)+
  autolayer(kidney_test_weekly,series = "SARIMA", color = "red")

```
I exclude the VAR model because it doesn't have any prediciton power shown above. 

## Model Comparasion
```{r}
aicc <- cbind(arima_atuo_kidney$aicc, arima_kidney$aicc, tbats_kidney$AIC,
              summary(model_arfima)$aic, model_fourier$aicc , model_xreg$aicc) 
aicc
#sort(aicc)

rmse <- c(acc_atuo[,2], acc_arima[,2], acc_tbats[2,2],
          acc_arfima[,2], acc_fourier[,2], acc_xreg[,2])
rmse 

data <- rbind(aicc,rmse)
comparison <- as.data.frame(t(data),row.name=c('Auto_arima','SARIMA','TBATS','ARFIMA','Fourier', 'Regression with arima error'))
colnames(comparison)<-c('AICC', 'RMSE')
comparison[order(comparison$RMSE),]


```

By Comparing all models' performance. TBATS has the best performance in fitting by showing the lowest RMSE. However, it has very high AICC, so I consider Fourier Transformation for Dynamic Harmonic Regression has the best performance.
